# My Personal Dotfiles

You will need to use stow to automatically link all of your configs into the correct locations.

## Setup
Just run the following command to stow all of your configs and ignore any files in the main directory. 
```bash
stow -t ~ */
```

## Todo

- [ ] Setup an arch install file for all of my current explicitly installed packages. Easy reinstall in the future.
- [ ] Create update script for updating system, node, yarn, python packages

## Docs
### Sway
- [ ] Add docs for sway
    - [ ] Document the roles of each file
    - [ ] Document the dependencies and add them to the install script.
